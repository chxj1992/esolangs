### 1. [Befunge](/Befunge93)
```
Befunge ———— 第一个变态语言。维基上面说——这门语言由Chris Pressey在1993年创造，本意为设计一种为难编译器的语言，
结果马上出现了一批编译器。
```
```
Befunge is a two-dimensional fungeoidal (in fact, the original fungeoid) esoteric programming language 
invented in 1993 by Chris Pressey with the goal of being as difficult to compile as possible.
